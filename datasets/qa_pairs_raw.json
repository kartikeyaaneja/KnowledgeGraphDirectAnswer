Matt Farrelly is a Chartered Quantity Surveyor and Associate Director with responsibility for the Cost Management/Quantity Surveying function in PM's Dublin office. Along with a post graduate qualification in construction law, Matt has contract administration experience on major project of value up to €500 million, under various forms of contract and procurement routes, including RIAI, GDLA, IEI Forms, FIDIC Orange and Red Books, MF/1, JCT '81 and '87 and bespoke forms. Key skills include cost management, value engineering, commercial risk management and whole life costing. Matt has carried out training in contract administration both internally in PM and for such bodies as Greencore, Dublin Airport Authority, UCD and Bristol Myers Squibb. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 15 2.2 The Capital Works Management Framework Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual The Capital Works Management Framework is a series of documents which collectively describe the operating environment, procedures and processes to be followed for the delivery of capital works projects. It incorporates contractual provisions, guidance material and technical procedures covering the public works project lifecycle from inception to final project delivery and review. The aim of the Capital Works Management Framework is to ensure that there is an integrated methodology and a consistent approach to the planning, management and delivery of public capital works projects with the objectives of greater cost certainty, better value for money and more efficient project delivery. The flow chart below describes the framework. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 16 Participants should refer to the separate Guidance Notes prepared by the GCCC as part of the Capital Works Management Framework, including: Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual (cid:131) (cid:131) Project Management Structure Project Definition (cid:131) Budget Development (cid:131) Procurement Strategy and Contract Type - Guidance Notes for Public Works Contracts - - Arbitration Rules - Model Forms Public Works Contracts (5) (cid:131) Consultants Appointment Process and Conditions of Engagement for Construction Consultants - - Procurement Guidance Notes Suitability Assessment of Consultants for Category 12 Services for Both Open and Restricted Procedures Standard Conditions of Engagement for Construction Consultants (cid:131) Design Development and Procurement Process - Design Process - Suitability Assessment of Works Contractors for Both Open and Restricted Procedures Procurement Guidance Notes - - (cid:131) Design Cost Control Procedures (cid:131) Tender Process - Template Public Works Tender Document (cid:131) Construction Process (cid:131) Construction Cost Control (cid:131) Project Review (cid:131) Analysis of Outturn Costs 2.3 The Background Public capital works projects generally fall into two sectoral classifications: (cid:131) Civil Engineering Works; (cid:131) Building Works. This division reflects some fundamental differences between the civil engineering and building sectors. Civil engineering works such as roads, tunnels, bridges etc. are designed by Civil Engineers acting [for the most part] under the direction of the Contracting Authority and are carried out by civil engineering contractors.

Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 17 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual Building works such as office buildings, schools and hospitals are designed by Architects (with other consultants) again acting [for the most part] under the direction of the Contracting Authority and are constructed by building contractors. In both sectors the standard forms of contract used in the past have been published by the lead professionals’ professional institutions. In the case of building works by the RIAI with the agreement of the Department of Finance, in the case of civil engineering works by the IEI, now Engineers Ireland. A number of contracting authorities have also used the various FIDIC and JCT forms suitably amended for use in Ireland. The old forms have not served the Public Sector well in the past, hence the introduction of the new forms which: (cid:131) Reflect the latest thinking in project and risk management; (cid:131) Are clear in terms of wording and in the allocation of risk; (cid:131) Recognise the development of new procurement methods such as design and build; (cid:131) Support the certainty of outcome in terms of cost, quality and programme that an effective capital asset delivery process demands. In the private sector it now common practice for the equivalent private sector forms, mainly the RIAI Form, to be heavily amended by clients’ solicitors with the objective maximising financial certainty by risk allocation. 2.4 The New Forms of Contract CAPITAL WORKS MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK Guidance Notes Building Works Civil Engineering Works Minor Building & Civil Engineering Works Public Works Contract for the Provision of Building Works Designed by the Employer.

Contract 5 above has been developed to both share and reduce the level of risk transfer to small/medium sized contractors for projects of value less than €5m. The new contracts are currently available at the free of charge following links: http://www.finance.gov.ie/ViewDoc.asp?fn=/documents/publications/other/construct reformdec06.htm&CatID=61&m=p http://www.e-tenders.gov.ie/guides/guides_list.aspx?type=2 On 19 May 2007 a charging mechanism will be introduced for the forms. Contracting Authorities – called \"Employers\" in the public works contracts – are now required to enter into fixed price lump sum contracts for public works, tendered on a competitive basis, with appropriate risk allocated to the contractor. This new arrangement will result in greater cost certainty, better value for money and more efficient delivery of public capital projects. This risk allocation is facilitated by the Contracting Authority providing appropriate information in the tender documents for the tenderers to assess and price. The information to be supplied will depend on the type of contract being used. The new forms of construction contracts must be applied to traditional and design and build public works in Ireland that are procured directly by a government department, bodies under its aegis, including local authorities or other relevant bodies that provide public services (e.g. schools, voluntary hospitals, etc). The new forms of construction contracts are to be used without amendments. In this context, the new forms have been drafted in a way that better protects the public sector client’s interest in order to achieve value for money outcomes from public expenditure on public works projects. However, in exceptional and rare circumstances, consideration can be given to amendments to non core Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 19 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual elements of the new forms of construction contracts. The request for any such amendments from those bodies required to use the new contracts should be submitted to the GCCC for consideration and approval as appropriate. Other public bodies (such as commercial semi-state bodies) wishing to use the new forms of construction contracts but with amendments, should also submit a request to the GCCC for consideration and approval as appropriate. Where the body procuring the public works project is not a government department or a body under its aegis or a local authority or other relevant body that provides public services (e.g. schools, voluntary hospitals, etc) and more than 50% of the funding for the project comes from a source other than the Exchequer, the government department or relevant body, as appropriate, should decide if the new Public Works contracts will apply. If it is decided not to use the new forms of construction contracts on a particular public works project, the Accounting Officer/Accountable Officer in the government department or the relevant public body must be satisfied that the contract terms in the other contract being used"

(cid:131) To all new public works projects where planning has commenced but where detailed tender documents have not been developed by Monday 19 February 2007. (cid:131) For those public works projects where detailed development of tender documents has commenced, contracting authorities can elect to use the new forms of construction contracts on or after Monday 19 February 2007.

(cid:131) Where a contracting authority, following appropriate training, wants to use the new forms of construction contracts on public works projects on a date earlier than Monday 19 February 2007.

Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 20 2.6 The Government’s Objectives Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual The introduction of the new forms of contract supports the Government’s objectives to: (cid:131) Move towards greater cost certainty at contract award stage and ensure as far as practicable that the accepted tender prices and the final cost are the same; (cid:131) Award contracts on the basis of a lump-sum fixed-price to the greatest extent possible; (cid:131) Rebalance risk so that there is optimal allocation of risk; (cid:131) Achieve value for money; and (cid:131) Achieve more efficient delivery of the projects. 2.7 The Aim of this Course The aim of this course is to support deployment of the new forms by introducing them to selected front line officers and to enable them share this knowledge with those officers yet to be trained to roll out use of the forms on the projects for which they are responsible. Having completed the course, participants should have: (cid:131) An appreciation of the Capital Works Management Framework; (cid:131) An understanding of the key differences between the new forms and those previously in use in their sectors; (cid:131) An understanding of the principles of risk assessment and appropriate risk"

Example: Reducing/Eliminating Risk It is understood that there may be contaminated soil on the site of a proposed project but there is no conclusive data on this matter. If the risk of this was to materialise during construction it would cause significant delay and a cost overrun, the effects of which would be greater than the actual cost of dealing with it in advance.

Under the Design and Build contracts it is the Contractor who has responsibility for: (cid:131) Design of the works; (cid:131) Completeness of the design of the works; (cid:131) Changes to the design of the works. However the Contracting Authority retains risk associated with any changes to the Works Requirements. There are particular projects that are not suited to the use of design-and-build contracts – these include certain major alteration or refurbishment projects and most maintenance projects. Contracting Authorities should be aware that the tender evaluation and award process for design-and-build contracts is more complex than for traditional contracts. This increased complexity gives rise to greater risks regarding transparency and objectivity in determining the most acceptable submission in accordance with the award criteria Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 34 5.3 What is new in terms of risk allocation? Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 1. The new forms for traditional contracts contemplate that the design by the Employer’s consultants will be comprehensively developed – the contracts do not provide for provisional sums or provisional quantities. thus there is a greater onus on contracting authorities to ensure completeness of design. 2. There is now an Irish standard form of contract for both building and civil engineering works under which the Contractor has responsibility and risk for design and completeness of design. 3. Contracts for the most part will be lump sum and the Contractors will own the \"quantities risk\", however Contracting Authorities can make a choice about the contractual status of the bill of quantities. 4. A new concept called Programme Contingency is introduced and Contractors are required to allow within the contract period and within the Contract Sum for a specified delay period, attributable to events which confer rights to extensions of time and financial compensation. 5. Risks associated with ground conditions, fossils, archaeology, human remains and utilities are now specifically referred to in the building contract; the GDLA form made no specific reference to these matters. 6. Employers can make choices at the time of tendering as to whether any of the following matters confer upon the Contractor the right to recover additional monies: a. Unforeseeable fossils, archaeology, human remains; b. Unforeseeable ground conditions [excepting under the Design & Build Form]; c. Unforeseeable utilities [excepting under the Design & Build Form]; d. Unforeseeable delays by utilities companies in relocating or disconnecting utilities. 7. Contractors can be required to submit at the time of tender their \"all in\" costs per day for events for which they are entitled to receive financial compensation. This is their only entitlement for such events and as such needs to be carefully estimated by contractors. 8. Force majeure and inability to secure labour and materials no longer entitles Contractors to extensions"

It is important to stress that such information is given without warranty. Contracting Authorities should be careful as to how below ground design information is presented in the Works Requirements, particularly in relation to dimensions of depths, depths drawn to scale, pile lengths or datum levels or bearing strata to be reached arising out of an interpretation of site investigation material. To disclose such information in the Works Requirements could result in a claim for re-measurement if the actual information is different when the ground is opened up. A Contracting Authority should allocate the risk associated with unforeseeable ground conditions to the Contractor when, having completed a thorough site investigation, either decides that there is no risk, or that the risk can be easily assessed and priced by tenderers. Risk Nr 20- Unforeseeable utilities in the ground [Traditional Contracts Only] Surveys which will be carried out during the preconstruction should identify the location and nature of any utilities traversing the site. In carrying out these surveys particular care should be exercised on existing non Greenfield sites or on public roads to locate such utilities with a degree of certainty. Contracting Authorities should adopt a practical approach to the issue of utilities if possible dealing with them in enabling works contracts. Contracting Authorities should allocate the risk associated with unforeseeable utilities to the Contractor when, having completed a thorough site survey, the Contracting Authority either decides that there is no risk, or that the risk can be easily assessed and priced by tenderers. Risk Nr 21- Owners of Utilities fail to relocate or disconnect utilities in a timely manner Contracting Authorities should adopt a practical approach to the issue of utilities. In some cases, a separate enabling works contract to relocate utilities in advance of the main contract may be advisable. A Contracting Authority should allocate the risk associated with relocation or disconnection of utilities to the Contractor when the Contracting Authority has agreed procedures with utilities owners as to their disconnection/relocation such that there is no risk, or that the risk can be easily assessed and priced. The overriding basis on which a Compensation Event risk is allocated to the Contractor should be that there is a low level of risk or that the Contractor is furnished with sufficient information to enable it assess and price the risk. A project risk strategy that attempts to allocate all risk to a Contractor by indiscriminate risk dumping is unlikely to achieve the objective of value for money.

When approaching the question of the appropriate Public Works contract, the first decision to be made is that of choice of procurement i.e. traditional or design and build. This topic is the subject of Guidance Note - Procurement Strategy and Contract Type under the Capital Works Management Framework and will be touched on very briefly here. Employer Designed The design process is contractually separate from construction and is carried out by designers engaged directly by the Contracting Authority. Complete detailed documentation is required before tenders can be invited for carrying out the work in return for a lump sum price. Design and Build The Contractor is responsible for undertaking both the design and the construction of the work in return for a lump sum price. Selection of the procurement strategy for the project entails considering the nature of the project, its risks and the programme available. For every project the Employer should focus on time, cost, performance and quality, in relation both to design and construction of the project in order to make an informed decision on the procurement strategy.

As between the building and civil engineering forms there are some minor differences. However the form deployed will depend on whether the work is predominantly of a civil engineering or building nature after which consideration should be given as to whether to follow the traditional or design and build route Example: A Government department requires a new green-field office building to accommodate some 200 staff to be provided on the outskirts of a major town. The options are: (i) Traditional procurement (ii) Design and build The Client’s requirements can be readily defined and it is not considered to be particularly complex project. The design and build route is selected as it provides a single point of contractual responsibility and most likely has the shortest overall programme whilst providing maximum financial certainty. 6.6 The Impact on the Project Programme Contracting Authorities need to be aware of the need to ensure that project risk issues are effectively addressed in contract documentation. They furthermore need to be aware, that workshops to identify these risks, with Employer participation, are necessary and that there is adequate provision in the project programme to allow time for this. Contracting Authorities should be aware of the following factors which should be considered when deciding on the programme for a project. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 48 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual The Works Requirements The Traditional Forms require that the Works Requirements will comprise comprehensive and well developed documentation which should include for example: • in the case of reinforced concrete works, full reinforcement drawings and not just estimated kilograms of reinforcement per m³ of concrete; • details of builder’s work in connection with mechanical and electrical services installations; Employers should note that the new forms of contract have no facility for provisional sums or provisional quantities and therefore any works which in the past were dealt with by these mechanisms will now be required to be fully designed and time should be allowed in the programme for this. The Works Requirements under the Design and Build forms by their very nature are different to those of the Employer Designed forms and are discussed further later The Site Site risk issues such as archaeology, ground conditions and utilities should be fully considered in order that appropriate and cost effective risk allocation may be achieved. The need for any enabling works contracts should also be considered as part of this strategy. The Employer has a judgement to make on"

With regard to the lump sum aspect the Contractor is to be given full and clear information as to the works to be carried out and the risks being allocated to the Contractor so as to enable him to fully price the works including those risks. While there is provision within the Contract for adjustment to the Contract Sum the areas of such adjustment are very specifically set out and regulated and are subject to strict notice conditions. It is therefore unlikely that such adjustments will arise without easily verifiable justification. The Contract is largely a fixed price although there is provision for adjustment in the case of extreme price fluctuations. As discussed elsewhere, some old forms are not entirely precise in their allocation of risk as between the parties. In addition, in many instances the Contractor is not given enough information at the appropriate time to enable him price risk. This has resulted in claims and disputes. The new forms allocate risk clearly and neither party should be in doubt as to the risks allocated to him and for which he must make provision. Also, as is stated above, the Contractor is to be given all information necessary to price such risks. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 52 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 8 Procurement, What is New? Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 53 8. 8.1 Procurement – What is New? Introduction Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual The CWMF deals with Procurement in the following guidance documents: (cid:131) Procurement Strategy & Contract Type; (cid:131) Tendering Process; (cid:131) (cid:131) Procurement Guidance for Suitability Assessment of Works Contractors; Standard Instructions for Tendering. In essence the public procurement regime is unchanged by the introduction of the new Public Works Contracts, however, the new forms introduce some new concepts and Contracting Authorities should be aware of how these should be dealt with to ensure compliance with the public procurement regime. The main changes are: (cid:131) The suitability assessment and procurement of specialists – the entities which replace the nominated sub-contractor (cid:131) Evaluation of tenders (cid:131) The letter of acceptance 8.2 Specialists Specialists can be procured in a number of ways: (i) Specialists are named by the bidders in their Works Proposals. The Contractor must have named its proposed specialists in its suitability assessment submission. It is important to note that at least one of the Contractor’s proposed specialists for each \"specialism\" must meet the suitability assessment criteria, otherwise the Contractor will also fail to prequalify. During the tender process, Contractors must confirm that the specialist work will be carried out by the specialist(s) that were accepted as part of the suitability assessment process. Note that any change by a Contractor from its initially suitable specialist to another specialist should be subject to a further suitability assessment by the Employer; (ii) The Employer may in exceptional circumstances name the proposed Specialist in the Works Requirements."

Note that any change by a Contractor from its initially suitable specialist to another specialist should be subject to a further suitability assessment by the Employer; (ii) The Employer may in exceptional circumstances name the proposed Specialist in the Works Requirements. In these circumstances a separate suitability assessment process and competition would have been held and the Specialist’s tender included in the Works Requirements for the Contractor to include in its tender; (iii) The Employer may, in exceptional circumstances, create a panel of specialists for a particular package and let tendering Contractors for the main contract choose from the panel and/or add others they wish to Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 54 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual propose by reference to the criteria given to them by the Employer and against which the panel was chosen; (iv) Specialists could be novated to the Contractor. This approach is broadly similar to that mentioned at (ii) above and would be considered appropriate for novated designers in a design and build scenario or where there are exceptionally long lead items. 8.3 Evaluation of Tenders The significant issues that arise with the introduction of the new contracts are: (a) Tenders are procured on a fixed price lump sum basis and there is no subsequent negotiation of the fixed price addition as has heretofore been the case; (b) Where bills of quantities are used for civil engineering works, the tender is the lump sum offer and not the rates in the bill of quantities; (c) Daily rates for delay, all-in labour rates and percentage additions for materials and plant are to be provided by tenderers. These will be required to be taken into account in the evaluation of tender.

Note that any change by a Contractor from its initially suitable specialist to another specialist should be subject to a further suitability assessment by the Employer; (ii) The Employer may in exceptional circumstances name the proposed Specialist in the Works Requirements. In these circumstances a separate suitability assessment process and competition would have been held and the Specialist’s tender included in the Works Requirements for the Contractor to include in its tender; (iii) The Employer may, in exceptional circumstances, create a panel of specialists for a particular package and let tendering Contractors for the main contract choose from the panel and/or add others they wish to Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 54 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual propose by reference to the criteria given to them by the Employer and against which the panel was chosen; (iv) Specialists could be novated to the Contractor. This approach is broadly similar to that mentioned at (ii) above and would be considered appropriate for novated designers in a design and build scenario or where there are exceptionally long lead items. 8.3 Evaluation of Tenders The significant issues that arise with the introduction of the new contracts are: (a) Tenders are procured on a fixed price lump sum basis and there is no subsequent negotiation of the fixed price addition as has heretofore been the case; (b) Where bills of quantities are used for civil engineering works, the tender is the lump sum offer and not the rates in the bill of quantities; (c) Daily rates for delay, all-in labour rates and percentage additions for materials and plant are to be provided by tenderers. These will be required to be taken into account in the evaluation of tender. Accordingly, the evaluation criterion used must be \"most economically advantageous tender\" and not the \"lowest tender\". Where daily rates are tendered the following should be added to each tender sum for the purpose of comparing tenders: − The product of the provisional number of days’ delay stated in the tender documents and the tenderer’s daily rate of delay cost. − The product of the provisional number of hours for each category of craftsperson, apprentice and general operative stated in the tender documents and the tenderer’s hourly rate for each. − The provisional cost of materials and plant in relation to compensation events stated in the tender documents multiplied by the tenderer’s percentage adjustment for each.

Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 55 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual Example: See Case Study Nr 2 and the Guidance Note on Public Works Contract (d) In most circumstances there is a pricing document, which tenderers complete during the tendering period. When a successful tender is selected and prior to issue of the letter of acceptance by the Employer, it may be necessary to deal with inconsistencies between rates, balancing of rates and errors in the pricing document – for example where not all of the items have been priced or where items may have been front loaded. Such corrections and rebalancing are necessary so that the rates and prices can be used to value work in interim progress valuations, and also that the rates and prices can be used to value change orders should they arise. Dealing with errors, inconsistencies and rebalancing of rates should be done and notified to the preferred bidder by the Employer before rejection of all the other tenders in case the preferred bidder does not stand over his tender. In limited circumstances – usually only in the case of some design-and-build contracts the pricing document may be very general. In these circumstances, a number of milestone payments are normally established for interim payment purposes. Where this is done it is preferable to indicate to bidders in the tender documents the percentage payable at each milestone. 8.4 Letter of Acceptance The issue of a letter of acceptance by an Employer to a tenderer forms a binding contract. The letter must be signed by a person authorised to sign contracts on behalf of the Employer. The Employer should make sure that all required approvals and supporting documents are in place before the letter is issued. The letter of acceptance should not be confused with the \"Alcatel\" letter or a letter of intent.

Note that this means he only recovers the amount in excess of 10% of WYZP, and this is not equivalent to saying \"He bears the risk of the first 10% of the increase\"; it is more exacting than that. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 65 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual The term WYZP, as mentioned above, represents the sum which is subject to the index calculation, for this particular material, in this particular Interim Certificate. Calculation of the amount, subject to the price variation calculation, in an interim certificate after the Base Date (except for Hyperinflation) would follow along the lines of the following example, and the proportion factors in Figure 1. Contract Sum (excluding VAT) and any price adjustments under this Clause €6,285,000.00 Less excluded amounts (say) €285,000.00 Z = €6,000,000.00 W= nominal weighting attributed to the relevant Material or Fuel Category. In this case: Ready Mixed Concrete Fabricated structural steel Y= Nominal percentage of Materials in the Contract Sum. In this Case 20% 28% 35% P= Percentage of the amount of the relevant material Category in the relevant Interim or Final Certificate related to the total amount of that Material category in the Contract Sum In this case: Ready Mixed Concrete Fabricated structural steel Applying these together we have: Ready Mixed Concrete - 25% 10% W x Y x Z x P = 20% x 35% x €6,000,000 x 25% = €105,000 Fabricated Structural Steel - W x Y x Z x P = 28% x 35% x €6,000,000 x 10% = €58,800 These are the sums, under the headings of Ready Mix Concrete and Fabricated Structural Steel, which appear in the PVC calculation in the current Interim Valuation. However, it will only be the amounts in excess of €10,500 and €5,880 respectively, ie 10% of WYZP, which will be recoverable, and then only if the index uplift generates an excess. Clearly, it is possible that the formula at the head of this section could give a value which is negative, and this happens when the uplift from the indexation calculation is less than 10%. The Clauses of the Contract make it clear that when this happens, the outcome is a zero recovery for the Contractor. Hyperinflation is defined in the Contract, and it can apply at any time after the Designated Date, which means it can apply as a relief even during the \" fixed price period\" when normal price relief does not apply. The structure of the Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 66 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual Hyperinflation Formula is mathematically the same, except the 10% of WYZP factor is 50% of WYZP in that instance.

There are worked examples in the Guidance Note of how the Hyperinflation Formula is to be applied. Weightings for Materials, Fuel and Other Items In Employer Design Contracts, the Employer will define the weighting Y, and weighting(s) W across a range of materials, by preparing two Tables, for inclusion in the appendices to the ITT. It is important that the headings in the table match those used by the CSO, so that there is unambiguously an index available for each material category. Figure 1 illustrates how these weights apply down the tree into each material category and interim certificate. In Contractor Design, the Contractor will have to present his own weightings against the corresponding materials categories, and good practice would then require that this be taken into the account in the MEAT calculation as part of tender appraisal. This might be done by declaring that tender comparisons would be made, based on five ranked assumed materials values, with the highest five weightings (for example) applied and taken to a sum itself taken into account in the MEAT, to prevent any tendency to load a particular material category for advantage. In the above example, the following indices are used: A1=The Adjustment Index Figure for the relevant Material or Fuel Category B1=The Base Index figure for the relevant Material or Fuel Category If now the indices took the following values and we were considering a September 2008 Interim Valuation: Designated Date: 15 January, 2005 Base Date: 1 August, 2008 CSO Indices (Material Category) Jan-05 Aug-08 Sept-08 Ready mixed concrete Fabricated structural steel 106 102 105.3 126.36 109 124 The fractional amount of uplift, less the amount at the Contractors risk, can be calculated as: Ready Mixed Concrete ⎧ ⎛ ⎜ ⎨ ⎝ ⎩ A 1 B 1 − 1 B ⎞ −⎟ ⎠ ⎫ 1.0 ⎬ ⎭ = ⎧ ⎛ ⎜ ⎨ ⎝ ⎩ 126 3. 36. 105 − 3. 105 ⎞ −⎟ ⎠ ⎫ 1.0 ⎬ ⎭ = 1.0 Fabricated Structural Steel ⎧ ⎛ ⎜ ⎨ ⎝ ⎩ 1 1 A B − 1 B ⎞ −⎟ ⎠ ⎫ 1.0 ⎬ ⎭ = ⎧ ⎛ ⎜ ⎨ ⎝ ⎩ 124 0. 0. − 109 109 0. ⎞ −⎟ ⎠ ⎫ 1.0 ⎬ ⎭ = .0 0376146 Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 67 Having calculated the sum entering the PVC calculation, and the net uplift factor, it remains to combine the two, in the following formula.

The Employer must provide for the amount of the Bond as a percentage of the initial Contract Sum up to Substantial Completion and thereafter (note – the level of the Bond depends on the size of the Contract. It ranges from 25% to 12.5% (see Guidance Note section 2.3). There is provision for the Bond to reduce by one half upon Substantial Completion of the Works. 11.7 Section F The Employer must state if collateral warranties are required from certain Specialists and by what date. Example: Almost by definition it is likely that a Specialist will be carrying out a design function and in many cases the Specialist company will be as substantial, if not more so, than the Contractor. For instance, some of the larger mechanical and electrical contractors are substantially larger than many of the contractors for whom they work as specialist sub-contractors. Accordingly, unless the Employer feels that a separate warranty from the Specialist need not be provided because of the likely stature of the Contractor (who he will not of course know when completing the Schedule) and/or the fact that the type of work to be carried out by a Specialist is unlikely to fail, it would be most unusual not to require such a warranty. Example: The Employer is entitled to withhold from payments to the Contractor, the amount set out in the table in the Schedule (part1F) in the event that the Contractor fails to provide a collateral warranty within the time he is obliged to do so (sub-clauses 5.5 and 11.4.1). The Employer will need to consider the amount to be withheld on the Contractor and must insert it in the Schedule. The money will be paid to the Contractor when he provides the required warranty. However, if he has not done so by the date of issue of the Defects Certificate, the withheld amount is deducted from the Contract Sum (sub-clause 11.4.5). Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 78 11.8 Section G Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual Unless the Contractor is required to insert the Date for Substantial Completion in part 2 of the Schedule the Employer will need to consider the date. This will obviously be considered in conjunction with the Employer’s consultants and by reference to the size of the job and the time frame within which the Works are required. It may perhaps be that certain parts of the Works will be required separately and in that context sectional completion might be envisaged with separate Dates for Substantial Completion in each case. If the Contractor is required to insert the Date for Substantial Completion the Employer should consider imposing (via the Works Requirements) a minimum period for completion in light of safety considerations (see comments on this point elsewhere).

If sectional completion is required, the Employer must insert the rate of liquidated damages for each Section and any reduction of retention moneys on Substantial Completion of a Section Note: LADs must be a genuine pre-estimate of actual losses so as not to be a penalty and therefore unenforceable Example: The rate of liquidated damages per day or per week will be inserted by the Employer and in this regard the Employer should assess carefully the likely losses to be suffered by the Employer should any Section or ultimately the entire Works be delayed due to the Contractor’s default. The Employer should make sure that the amount in question is a genuine pre-estimate of likely actual losses. In point of fact many Employers insert liquidated damages that do not take into account all of their likely losses and accordingly such liquidated damages are too low. Obviously, the Employer should be aware that a rate which is so high that it bears no relationship to the anticipated actual losses is likely to be unenforceable as a penalty. There is also provision here for a reduction in retention on Substantial Completion of a Section and in this regard the Employer should consider the relationship that the Section in question bears to the overall Works. If the Section is a very substantial part of the overall Works and represents 25% of it in monetary terms, it may be appropriate to reduce the retention by a similar percentage once that section is substantially complete. However, other factors may come into play which would result in the reduction not equating fully to the monetary relationship that the section bears to the overall works 11.9 Section H The Employer must state whether or not the Employer’s Representative is required to issue the certificate of Substantial Completion even if completion is early (note – the default is that early certification is required). Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 79 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual The Employer will have to decide whether or not he is happy that the ER should issue the Certificate of Substantial Completion if the Contractor completes either a Section or the entire Works before the relevant Date for Substantial Completion. As the default is that the ER will have to issue the Certificate the decision on the Employer’s part is whether he would prefer not to take over the Works or the Section early. It might perhaps be that the Employer will not be ready for the Works until the actual Date for Substantial Completion and will not want to take it on for that reason, and particularly may not wish to have the obligation to insure, take over and provide security for the building. 11.10 Section I The Employer must insert the length of the initial Defects Period Example: The Employer might wish to consider whether either a shorter period"

The standard criteria listed in the definition of \"weather event\" in the Schedule part 1K are rainfall, air temperature and wind speed. The Schedule provides for a 10 year Return Period as the level of risk to be allocated to the Contractor in this respect. This has a precise hydrological meaning, as the event which, in a long record, is likely to be exceeded once in 10 years. It is not equivalent to an event which occurred within the last decade for example. In a project lasting perhaps 24 – 36 months at construction stage, there is a significant probability of the 10 year event occurring, be that rainfall, or wind, or temperature. Furthermore, it is not impossible (although the probability is low) that a 10 year Return Period event could occur twice within a construction period. The Contractor carries that risk. The Employer must insert in the Schedule, in the table provided, any additional criteria decided upon as appropriate to the Works and the relevant weather station at which those criteria will be measured. It would seem appropriate that Met Éireann may have to be consulted on the appropriate weather station to be entered in the Schedule by the Employer, as the Climatological Station most representative of conditions at the Site of the Works.

Works Requirements, Works Proposals and Pricing Document 13.1 Works Requirements These contain the Employer’s requirements for the Works It is also important that the Contractor is provided with all relevant information so as to enable him to price the risks being imposed on him. The Employer should possibly furnish: (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) site surveys subject to such caveats as may be appropriate (eg, that interpretation is the responsibility of the Contractor) archaeological surveys utility details It is essential therefore that the Employer does not proceed to tender prematurely (ie, before fully detailed Works Requirements are prepared) despite any pressures on him to do so. In the case of a Design and Build Contract the Works Requirements will contain a robust output specification or specimen design so that the Contractor can fully understand and price what is required of him and so that the Employer will get what he requires. Archaeological Surveys can range from a desk study level of detail, to a field investigation with geophysics and investigation trenches, depending on the known history of the site and the area. Fieldwork associated with archaeology requires permissions from the NMS of the DoELG, and can involve a significant lead-in time. It is clearly important, when the risk associated with archaeological artefacts is being transferred to the Contractor, that the level of prior investigation is selected to manage that risk transfer effectively, so that it is appropriate to transfer it, and that such transfer represents value for money. Utility details would be approached initially by researching the as-constructed records of the Utilities in question and from local knowledge. This might be followed by cable detection surveys, and trial trenches to confirm the positions of buried services. Again these approaches represent a continuum of prior effort by the Employer to manage risk to a level where it can be effectively transferred to the Contractor. 13.2 Works Requirements Documents The documents containing the Works Requirements provided by the Employer are identified in Part One of the Schedule.

Contracting authorities should consider the risks of including site surveys, site investigation reports, archaeology reports, etc. in Works Requirements. An alternative would be to provide such information with tender documentation as relevant background information; notwithstanding this, such documents should be accurate and proportionate to the nature and scale of the proposed Works. 13.3 Works Proposals These will include method statements, Contractor’s design and any other information required by the Employer in relation to the carrying out of the Works Example: Works proposals from the Contractor will vary depending on whether the Contract is Traditional or Design and Build. With Traditional, the Contractor would be likely to prepare his intended sequence of work, his programme, his resource allocation and his method statements as an integrated package of information, in response to the Contract Documents, including whatever constraints are stipulated by the Employer therein. In a civil engineering project, for example, he would indicate how he proposed to deploy available working space around structures, showing locations where he might safely stockpile excavated material, or locate concrete batching plant and aggregate stockpiles materials, or Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 90 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual the like. Alternatively, he would outline other arrangements he may have made to obtain additional lands, licences and permits in order to free up working space on a particularly congested site. His sequences would address the question of re-use of materials, and disposal of C&D wastes. If he considers that Road Closures are required to perform the works, he would outline their sequence, duration, alternative routes to be used, and the like. His proposed working methodologies would be described, including any measures for environmental or HSW protection. With Design and Build, the Works Proposals will include information similar to the foregoing, but also the Contractor’s Design itself, including drawings of temporary and permanent Works, finishes schedules, calculations and all necessary information to enable the ER to technically assess the proposal in Tender Appraisal. 13.4 The Pricing Document"

The Contractor’s obligation runs from (and includes) the Starting Date up until the issue of the Certificate of Substantial Completion of the Works (or if completed in sections – the relevant Section). If part of the Works is taken over before Substantial Completion the obligation ends for that part when the Employer takes it over. The Contractor still has some responsibility for damage to the Works after the date of Substantial Completion. These include damage arising from defects or from matters that occurred before Substantial Completion. In addition if any damage to the Works is caused after Substantial Completion by activities of the Contractor or those for whom he is responsible this is at the Contractor’s risk. The Contractor is obliged to repair any loss or damage to any of the Risk Items (this is irrespective of responsibility) and must do so at his own expense if the insurance proceeds are insufficient for the purpose. The Contractor must in any event repair any damage to the Works occurring before the issue of the Defects Certificate if the Employer instructs him to do so (subject to payment for the Works in the event that the risk is not one for which the Contractor is responsible). Insurance of the Works Reference sub-clause 3.3, Schedule (part 1D) The Contractor must insure the Works and the other Risk Items, against loss or damage and must procure that the Contractor, Employer, and other persons nominated by the Employer are named as co-insured under the policy of insurance. The insurance is to be kept in place until the date of the Certificate Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 98 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual of Substantial Completion. Where there are Sections the insurance must remain in place until the Substantial Completion of the Section in question. The Employer may require in the Schedule (part 1D) that the insurance for any Section or part of the Works which has reached Substantial Completion is to be extended until Substantial Completion of the entire of the Works. The Contractor must maintain the insurance of the Works between Substantial Completion and the issue of the Defects Certificate in respect of damage for which he is responsible. The insurance level must include as a minimum for the full reinstatement cost of the property, demolition and debris removal, delivery, professional fees, inflation during the construction and reinstatement periods and profit. The Employer is entitled to insert in the Schedule (part 1D) any other property belonging to the Employer that is to be included in the insurance of the Works and the indemnity limit for such additional insurance.

The Employer is entitled to be paid out of the account for costs incurred by it in this regard and is also entitled to the balance remaining in the account after rectification work. Example: If the Works are fully insured in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause 3.3. and if a fire that arises on Site damages a substantial portion of the Works, then the Contractor would typically be instructed to repair the damaged Works which includes demolition of the damaged part, removal of the debris from the Site, and reinstatement. Additional professional fees would be incurred in dealing with design. The Contractor would submit interim statements in accordance with the provisions of the Contract and the ER would certify payment on foot of these. The Insurer of the Works would pay out the insurance proceeds which (other than professional fees in the circumstances of a traditional contract) would be paid into a joint bank account set up by the Employer in the joint names of the Employer and the Contractor. These monies would be paid out on foot of interim certificates by the ER as stated above. In relation to professional fees, assuming this was a traditional form of contract; the Employer would discharge the additional consultant’s fees and would be paid out of the bank account. Subject to any entitlement which the insurer might have, the Employer would be paid the balance remaining in the bank account after payment for the reinstatement of the Works. Indemnity and Liability Reference sub-clauses 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, Schedule (part 1D) The Contractor provides a full indemnity to the Employer and the Employer’s employees against all liability and loss of or damage to the Employer’s property including the Site arising from the performance of the Contract.

The Contractor is obliged to provide Public Liability insurance with the Employer and the Contractor as co-insured parties from the Starting Date until the issue of the Defects Certificate (sub-clause 3.6.1). The Contractor must take out Employer’s Liability insurance for his own personnel and in relation to Sub-Contractors he must either ensure that the Sub-Contractors maintain the insurance or otherwise cover the risk himself (sub-clause 3.6.2).

The Employer should require that the Contractor puts in place Professional Indemnity insurance in most cases where there is an element of design being carried out by the Contractor or Specialists.

    "chunk_full": "for at least this period. It is also likely that such defects will come to light within such a period. The Employer should take care to monitor the Contractor’s insurances either through the ER or directly through his own insurance advisors or by himself particularly so as to make sure that the Contractor’s Professional Indemnity insurance is renewed each year unless (which would be most unusual – one insurance policy is actually taken out to cover a six year period). This is particularly important in the case of Professional Indemnity insurance because such insurance operates on a \"claims made\" basis. That is to say, any claim is covered by the insurance that is in place during the year in which the claim is made. Thus if the Contractor discontinues his Professional Indemnity insurance after 2 years and a claim is made in year 3 there will be no cover. The Employer in completing the Schedule will also wish to consider the minimum indemnity limit. This should be a reasonable sum by reference to the value of the Works, the importance of the design work being carried out and the effect that a failure of such design work would have. One would expect that Professional Indemnity cover nowadays would be at the very least €6.5 million and possibly €10 million in the aggregate. The Employer is also entitled to stipulate that the professional indemnity insurance will cover each and every event. In such a case the full insured sum would be available for every claim raised by the Employer (within a particular year of cover). However, the normal Professional Indemnity insurance by Contactors is an aggregate sum for each year. That is to say a sum insured of €10 million will cover all claims made against the Contractor during the year in question. The risk with this type of cover is that the entire insured amount could be used up by one single claim and in the event of other claims arising there would be no insurance cover left to meet them. It is provided in the Schedule that the sum indemnified may include defence costs. The Employer should be careful if prosecuting a claim against an Insured where such costs are included in the cover, to take cognisance of this fact as, if a substantial legal defence was mounted to any claim the legal costs incurred by the defendant would eat away at the limit of indemnity leaving a diminishing \"pool\" for the Employer to claim against. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 101 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual The Contractor must place his insurance with insurers approved by the Employer and may only exclude from cover the exclusions listed in the schedule (part 1D). Any liability insurance where the Employer and Contractor are co-insured must include various provisions so that the Insurer cannot claim against either of the insured persons themselves and that they are each treated as if they were separately insured. The Contractor is obliged contractually to comply with all the terms of the insurance"

    "chunk_full": "where the Employer and Contractor are co-insured must include various provisions so that the Insurer cannot claim against either of the insured persons themselves and that they are each treated as if they were separately insured. The Contractor is obliged contractually to comply with all the terms of the insurance policies. The Contractor must provide evidence to the Employer that the insurances are in effect and must provide copies of policies and receipts for premiums in this regard. An Insurance Broker’s Certificate (or one from an underwriter) may be provided in the case of Professional Indemnity insurance. This is particularly important in the context of firstly checking on the Contractor’s insurances in advance of his coming on site and secondly keeping a check on the Contractor’s insurance during the course of the Works. The Contractor must notify the Employer promptly of any cancellation, renewal, non-renewal or material reduction of the terms of any policy. While this clauses imposes a contractual obligation on the Contractor to notify of these events it is imperative that the Employer or the E.R. keep an ongoing check on Contractor’s insurances as it is possible that a Contractor who is in a position whereby some of his insurances are being cancelled would not inform the Employer or the E.R. of this fact readily. The Employer is of course entitled to take out insurance should the Contractor fail to maintain them. However, it would not be possible for the Employer to take out Professional Indemnity insurance in respect of Contractor or at least not to do so without great difficulty. The Works Requirements may make provision for an owner controlled insurance programme and in such a case the provisions of clause 3 are to be amended accordingly (sub-clause 3.9.9). Example: If the Works involve very substantial and complex work over many adjoining areas with numerous Specialists it might be deemed appropriate by the Employer to control the insurance programme rather than running the risk of any insurance failures. However, careful investigation would need to be done by the Employer in this regard particularly in relation to the cost of taking out such a programme as it is unlikely to be as economic for an Employer to take out such insurance as it would be for a Contractor to do so. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 102 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 14.4 Management Co-operation Reference sub-clause 4.1 The Contract provides for co-operation between both parties but very importantly states that such co-operation does not alter the rights or duties of the parties or imply any admission of responsibility.

If the Contractor does not comply, the Employer is entitled to estimate the amount due to work persons and to deduct it from payments due to the Contractor until satisfied that the persons have been paid. (sub-clause 5.3.6) The Contractor must give a certificate together with each interim statement stating that the requirements of payment to personnel etc. have been complied with in relation to the Works the subject of the interim certificate. Failure to do so, or to comply with the provisions of sub-clause 5.3 will render the Contractor liable to the Employer for any investigation costs incurred. In addition, no payment will be made to the Contractor for the work in question until the certificate is furnished (sub-clause 5.3.7 and 11.4.4). See comments on this issue at 11.11 above.

Unless a Specialist is named in the Contract, the ER cannot instruct the Contractor to enter into a contract with that Specialist. The Contractor is not entitled to allow to be terminated or to accept a repudiation of his contract with a Specialist without first giving details to the ER. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 113 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual An exception to this obligation is when the Specialist becomes insolvent or has committed a serious breach of health and safety law or has failed to put in place or to maintain the required insurances. If the Contractor does terminate his Contract with a Specialist, he must replace the Specialist, having first submitted details of the proposed replacement to the ER. There is an entitlement on the part of the ER to object to he proposed replacement if, in his view, the proposed replacement does not have at least the experience, qualifications, competence, technical capacity and financial standing of the person he is replacing. Where a collateral warranty is required from a Specialist, that should be specified in the Schedule (Part 1F) with a certain date by which the Contractor must provide the warranty (see Model Form 10). The concept of the Specialist is new. Nominated sub-contractors are now replaced by Specialists for whom the Contractor is fully responsible. Specialists and the Specialist Works are to be set out in the Works Requirements or in the Works Proposals. The most likely and indeed the \"default\" scenario will be that the Contractor will provide his own Specialists in relation to specific Works Items and will be suitability assessed with those Specialists and will then include for them fully in the Contract Sum. The engagement of a Specialist by the Employer in advance of the Contractor's engagement is unlikely to be the norm. In the event of a novation, the Contractor will have provided in the Contract Sum for all work to be carried out by the Specialist for him. Example: The Contractor, in pre-qualifying for a building or engineering project, includes for the carrying out of certain work by Specialists (say mechanical and/or electrical work) Subsequent to pre-qualification, the Contractor will include that Specialist in his Works Proposals and the full price for those Specialist works is included in the Contract Sum. The administration of that Specialist is then entirely the responsibility of the Contractor so far as the Employer is concerned. Alternatively, the Employer might decide, because of the long lead-in period for the Specialist works, to enter into a contract with the Specialist in advance of contracting with the Main Contractor. The name of the Specialist and all documentation relating to the Specialist must be inserted into the Works Requirements for pricing by the Contractor. The Contractor must then accept the transfer of that contract to him and the Contractor accepts all liability for the work carried out by that"

The tests are to be set out in the Contract (in the Works Requirements or in the case of Contractor’s Design, in the Works Proposals) and the Contractor is obliged to carry them out, agreeing the time and place with the ER and giving him an opportunity to attend. In any event, the Contractor has to provide a certified copy of the test results (sub-clause 8.4). Where any test fails, the Contractor may be required to repeat it or may elect to do so. The Contractor is obliged to pay the Employer for any costs incurred as a result of retesting. Once a defect has been rectified, any test on the relevant Works Item must be repeated if the ER requires that this be done (sub-clause 8.4). Although a provision in relation to testing would not have been set out in the old forms, it would in all likelihood have been contained in the Preliminaries section of the BOQ or in the Specification. Provision is made at sub-clause 8.5 for the detection and remedying of defects in the Works. The ER may instruct the Contractor to search for defects or suspected defects including uncovering of any work etc. If no defect is found, the cost of searching and any delay caused, will entitle the Contractor to an extension of time and to compensation. (sub-clause 8.5 and Schedule part 1K at item 2) If a defect is made known to the ER because of investigations or otherwise he may tell the Contractor to: (cid:131) Remove the Works Item with the defect from the site; (cid:131) Demolish the defective Works Item if incorporated in the Works; (cid:131) Reconstruct, replace, or correct the Works Item in question; (cid:131) Not to deliver the defective Works Item to the site if relevant. Or the ER may do any combination of the above. (sub-clause 8.5.2) As would be the case under the older forms of contract should the Contractor fail to comply with a direction by the ER under sub-clause 8.5 within a reasonable time, the Employer is entitled to have the work done by others and the Contractor is obliged to pay for the costs of this. (sub-clause 8.5.3). Should a defect be serious enough to deprive the Employer of the benefit of the entire Works or any particular Section or other material part of the Works, the ER may on behalf of the Employer reject the Works or the relevant Section and in that case the Contractor must repay to the Employer any amounts that the Employer has paid to the Contractor in respect of the Works (in the case of the entire) or relevant part together with all"

    "chunk_full": "Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual In order to insert the appropriate date in the Schedule the Employer will need to consider the Date for Substantial Completion of the Works (and each Section of the Works if there is to be sectional completion). In this regard the Employer will doubtless consider the date by which the project is required, the practical issues associated with its (design and) construction, for instance, whether it is subject to matters such as tides (in relation to projects such as outfalls) or seasonal issues (perhaps work in mountainous or boggy areas). As there can be no compromise in relation to questions of Health and Safety it would be important where the Contractor is himself asked to insert the Date for Substantial Completion that the Employer consider any Health and Safety impact of this. For instance it might be appropriate for the Employer to insert in the Works Requirements, a minimum period for completion based upon his estimate of what this should be in order to avoid any risks in respect of Health and Safety. The Contractor must complete the Works (or Section) by the relevant Date for Substantial Completion. The Date for Substantial Completion may be delayed as a result of Delay Events as set out in the Schedule (part 1K) subject to the provisions of the Contract. Where an extension of time is granted in accordance with the Contract, a new Date for Substantial Completion applies. (sub-clause 9.3.2) Such an extension of time will apply to the Works and to any Section (if there is sectional completion) affected by the delay. The term \"Substantial Completion\" is very comprehensively defined in sub- clause 1.1 The Works are complete and can be taken over and used for their purpose. There are no defects save: (cid:131) Ones accepted by Employer (sub-clause 8.5.4) (cid:131) Minor defects that do not prevent the use of the Works for their purpose - - The ER agrees that the Contractor has reasonable grounds for not promptly fixing them (cid:131) Those whose fixing will not prejudice safe and convenient use of the Works (or part) (cid:131) All tests have been passed (that must be passed before Substantial Completion) (cid:131) Documents required before Substantial Completion have been furnished (cid:131) Collateral warranties have been provided in relation to the Works or relevant part While the Contractor’s basic obligation to complete the works by the Date for Substantial Completion is no different to that in the old forms of contract, the Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 123 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual actual requirements that have to be fulfilled before Substantial Completion are perhaps set out more clearly than in the previously utilised forms.

Example: See Case Study Nr 3 – Delay and Compensation Events The notice requirements in relation to delays and the granting of extensions of time are clearly set out in the Contract and the Delay Events which give rise to an extension of time are clearly set out in the Schedule. The ER will be required to assess whether the Notice Requirements have been satisfied and whether the requisite information is being furnished by the Contractor before granting any extension to the Date for Substantial Completion. The ER will have to assess whether (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) there was a Delay Event the Contractor has fulfilled his notice requirements the Contractor is otherwise entitled to an extension of time in accordance with sub-clause 9.3.2 and that the procedures in clause 10 have been followed The ER will also have to consider very carefully whether, in the light of particular circumstances, he might wish to grant an extension of time despite the fact that no such extension has been sought by the Contractor (sub-clause 10.5.2). The Programme Contingency Reference – Schedule (part 1K) sub-clause 9.4 The Programme contingency is provided for in the Schedule (part 1K). The Employer provides in the Schedule for two (sequential) thresholds for delay in Substantial Completion due to certain Compensation Events. The Contractor Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 127 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual prices these items and includes them in the initial Contract Sum and also in his programme. If a delay is caused to the Date for Substantial Completion of the Works due to relevant Compensation Events but that delay remains below the first threshold – the Contractor has no entitlement to an extension of time. If the delay due to relevant Compensation Events exceeds the first threshold then the ER deducts from that delay (i) the number of days stated in the first threshold, (ii) half the number of days delay in excess of the first threshold. But the total number of days to be deducted at (ii) above cannot exceed the number of days in the second threshold. Example: Thus if the Employer had inserted 20 days for first threshold and 30 days for second threshold – in respect of a 60 day delay (due to relevant Compensation Events) the Contractor would be entitled to a 20 day extension of time i.e. 60 days less 20 days (first threshold period) = 40 days ÷ 2 (to get half of the excess over the second threshold)= 20 days As 20 days is less than the second threshold the figure of 20 days is also deducted Therefore 60 days – (20 days + 20 days) = 20 days extension of time On each assessment of extensions of time by the ER he must tell the Contractor how much of the Programme Contingency has been used up.

It would be incumbent upon the ER in conjunction with the Employer to set up a system for dealing with such claims so that they can be responded to promptly and fully. As with notices of delay the ER will have to assess whether or not the Contractor is prime facia entitled to an adjustment to the extension of time/Contract Sum or any other entitlement claimed, and to assess whether or not he has provided all details required under the Contract and within the relevant periods. In this regard the ER will be well aware that the notice requirements under clause 10 are conditions precedent to the Contractor’s entitlement. Thus, if the Contractor fails to give notice in accordance with the sub-clause he will have no entitlement to the extension of time or adjustment unless the ER uses his discretion under sub- clause 10.5.2. It is possible that the Contractor may have fulfilled the requirements by means of a proposal in relation to a proposed instruction pursuant to clause 10.4 and the ER will have to be mindful of this. The ER will need to keep careful sight of all details of continuing delay and cost received from the Contractor, should have a firm and reasoned opinion on them and must be mindful of the fact that he himself is subject to a 20 working day period within which to respond to Contractor’s claims under sub-clause 10.3 or proposals under sub-clause 10.4. The ER will also have to keep in focus in relation to delay claims the use of the programme contingency so that it can be used where appropriate and the Contractor can be notified of the fact of its use and of the remaining amount of the contingency. Where a Compensation Event delays the carrying out of the Works so as to push the Contract into a consecutive period of 7 or more non-working days that would not otherwise have occurred the Contractor is entitled to compensation in respect of his expenses exclusive of profit or loss of profit. This is to be included in addition to the Contract Sum for the delay cost. However, the ER in assessing the amount should note that the amount to be paid in respect of the non-working days is not to exceed the sum arrived at by multiplying the Contractor’s tendered rate of delay cost by the non-working days being compensated for. It should be noted that a non-working day is defined as \"a day that, for good reason, is not a Site Working Day [such as a trade holiday.]\" In a case where the Contractor is required to and does provide in the Schedule Part 2 in respect of delay costs for parts of the Works then of course the rate quoted for the portion of the Works when the delay occurred is to be used as assessed by the ER.

The Pricing Document has an even more crucial role in providing the rates pursuant to which varied work will be paid for. The Pricing Document is to be used where it contains rates applicable to the additional, substituted or omitted work. If the nature of the work carried out is different to that in the Pricing Document the ER will use those rates as the basis for his evaluation. Otherwise he is to make a fair valuation which presumably would be based upon rates for similar work in the locality carried out under similar conditions.

If the delay cost option is chosen by the Employer, the Contractor’s tendered rate of delay costs is to be provided by him at tender stage (in the Schedule part 2E) in accordance with the instruction contained in the Schedule part 1K. An important point of note is that for periods of concurrent delay – there will be no increase in the Contract Sum if one of the causes of a delay is not a Compensation Event (sub-clause 10.7.2). The subject of liability for concurrent delays in construction has been the subject of much debate in the past. The provision in the Contract makes it clear that concurrent delays (i.e. periods of delay for which there are more than one cause) will not be compensated unless all are Compensation Events. This can be argued for on the basis that there is in fact no net delay for which the Employer has agreed to adjust the Contract Sum While it is unlikely that a contractor would seek an extension of time due to a cause that was not a Compensation Event where such delay was concurrent with a \"compensatable delay\", the ER ensure that extensions are granted for such causes, using the discretion under sub-clause 10.5.2 if necessary. Example: For instance, if the same period of delay is due to a combination of the failure by the Employer to give the Contractor a Works Item or other thing required by the Contractor after the Contractor has asked for it (sub-clause 4.10) [both a Delay Event and a Compensation Event] and say, a weather event as defined in the Schedule Part IK [a Delay Event but not a Compensation Event] then the Contractor would not be entitled to"

No delay costs are payable in respect of extension of time for completion of Sections. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 133 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual The Schedule at part 1K requires the Contractor to tender in part 2E either a single rate for delay costs or, if required to do so, a separate rate for delay costs for various portions of the Works. The Contractor sets out the tendered delay costs in the Schedule at part 2E. These are rates per Site Working Day but excluding VAT. When the ER is calculating the adjustment to the Contract Sum in respect of the delay caused by the Compensation Event, he uses the Contractor’s tendered rate of delay costs to calculate the compensation in question. As can be readily appreciated, the insertion by the Contractor of a delay rate in the Schedule and its use by the Employer in compensating for relevant delays that may occur, greatly simplifies the entire process of payment for delays to a contract. When taken in conjunction with the provision in sub-clause 10.7.4 to the effect that the Contractor has no other entitlement for delays, it should act so as to avoid global and other claims for prolongation of contracts that have dogged the industry over the years.

The ER will have to ensure that in making any determination of sums due or likely to become due by the Contractor to the Employer, he is careful that no injustice is done to either party. 14.11 Payment Interim Payment Reference – Schedule part 1L and sub-clause 11 Interim payments arise: (cid:131) at the periods for interim payments in the Schedule (part 1L) (provided the minimum payment amount in the Schedule is reached) (cid:131) on the issue of the Certificate of Substantial Completion for the Works or a Section (sub-clause 11.1.1) On these occasions the Contractor must provide a statement to the ER showing (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) the progress of the Works the payment he says is due a detailed breakdown of the sum any supporting evidence the ER requires a certificate pursuant to clause 5.3.7 (that the Contractor has complied with clause 5.3 in relation to the work, the subject matter of the certificate) (cid:131) on Substantial"

Example: If a payment has been certified in a certain amount and the Employer is aware that the Contractor has not provided a collateral warranty by the date stated in the Schedule (part 1F) then the Employer may deduct the amount due pursuant to the Schedule (part 1F) until that warranty has been provided. Similarly, in respect of the other items which the Contractor is required to give and in respect of which the Employer is entitled to deduct monies. It is noteworthy that in relation to the Certificate to be provided by the Contractor pursuant to sub-clause5.3.7 to the effect that work persons have been properly paid, unless the Contractor provides the Certificate the Employer may deduct the entire payment in respect of the Work Item in question and may ultimately permanently withhold the labour portion of the amount in question.

The Employer will have 15 days within which to pay the amount due falling which the Employer will become liable to interest at the rate provided in the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002.

It is likely that if the question of termination is being contemplated at all, that the matter has been going on for quite some time. If however the Employer is indeed seriously contemplating termination then he should discuss the matter in depth with the E.R and possibly with his legal adviser so that the correct approach is taken. For instance, if the matter is one which can be rectified then it would be essential for the ER to issue a formal direction to the Contractor to put the matter right and in this regard it would be useful to formally state that if the matter is not rectified within 14 days, the Employer intends to exercise his right to terminate the Contractor’s obligation to complete the Works. The Contractor should then be given the 14 days within which to put the matter right and only if he has not done so within that period should the Employer serve notice on the Contractor pursuant to sub-clause 12.1 terminating his obligation to complete the Works. Legal advice should be sought upon the format of the notice but in essence it must be clear and unequivocal and preferably should state precisely what it is and the fact that it is a notice pursuant to sub- clause 12.1 of the Contract. The notice should be sent in strict accordance with the provisions of sub-clause 4.14 and to the person named in the Schedule part 2A. It would also be important for the Employer and the ER to consider the position under the Bond or Bonds that have been provided by the Contractor and whether notification of the bondsman is appropriate (which is likely). If the Contractor persistently fails to honour his obligations to pay work persons properly then the Employer is entitled to serve notice of termination without the 14 day notice. Similarly, if an Insolvency Event as defined in sub-clause 12.1.1 occurs then the Employer may serve a notice of termination without any further notice. Consequences of Termination for Default Reference sub-clause 12.2 The consequences of termination for default are set out in clause 12.2 and include: (cid:131) The Contractor must leave the Site and not remove any Works Items or Contractor’s Things unless directed to do so (cid:131) Payments are postponed (cid:131) The ER makes an assessment (as soon as practical) of the amount due in respect of work done and not yet paid (the \"termination value\") Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 142 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual (cid:131) The Employer engages other contractors to use the Works Items and Contractor’s Things on the Site to complete the Works (cid:131) The Contractor must assign sub-contracts and supply contracts etc. to the Employer where directed to do so (cid:131) The Employer has discretion to pay sub-contractors or suppliers amounts already paid to the Contractor and the Contractor must re-pay those amounts (cid:131) The Contractor must hand over all Works Requirements and Contractor’s Documents to the Employer Once the Works have"

Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 146 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 14.13 Dispute Resolution Conciliation Reference sub-clause 13.1 The Contract provides that disputes arising in connection with, out of the Contract or Works are to be referred to conciliation and ultimately to arbitration if conciliation does not resolve the dispute. Either party can request conciliation by a notice in writing specified to be a notice under sub-clause 13.1 of the Contract. The parties must appoint the conciliator within 10 working days of the referral and in default the appointing body as set out in the Schedule (Part 1N) appoints. The parties must make all information and documents available to the conciliator that he requires. The conciliator may (cid:131) meet the parties separately or together (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) (cid:131) consider documents provided by one party and not shown to the other carry out investigations without the parties use specialist knowledge get legal or technical advice set out the procedures to be followed The conciliator’s appointment may be set out in the Works Requirements or otherwise as agreed. The Conciliator must give his recommendation if the dispute is not resolved within 42 days after his appointment (sub-clause 13.1.8). Each party has 45 days in which to give notice of dissatisfaction to the other party in writing (and specified to have been given under sub-clause 13.1). Such a notice may issue in the event that no recommendation is given within 45 days of the appointment (sub-clause 13.1.9). Once notice of dissatisfaction has been given, either party may serve notice of arbitration on the other (sub-clause 13.1.9). If no notice of dissatisfaction is given within 45 days from receipt of the recommendation – the recommendation becomes binding on both parties and they can enforce it by reference to arbitration (sub-clause 13.1.10). If a payment of money is recommended (even if notice of dissatisfaction is given) the money must be paid once a bond is furnished as security by the party Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 147 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual receiving payment (the form of bond may be provided in the Works Requirements Model Form 17) (sub-clause 13.1.11) . The conciliation is confidential. The conciliation process is relatively straightforward. One thing that is new in the forms of Contract is the provision at sub-clause 13.1.11 to the effect that if a payment of money is recommended by the Conciliator the money is to be paid over upon the provision of a bond as security.

There is also provision for the repayment where applicable of money paid over on foot of a conciliator’s recommendation or interest earned on such moneys where an arbitrator’s award is for a lesser amount than the sum originally paid over. (sub-clause 13.1.1). Example: If the Employer has discharged the monies due on foot of the conciliator’s recommendation and has received a bond from the Contractor Firstly, when considering the form of bond to be furnished by the Contractor in exchange for payment on foot of the recommendation it may be appropriate to consider carefully the proposed expiry date of the bond. This is because the Employer may be confronted with an arbitration which may drag on for a considerable period and a bond which will be due to expire within a set period of time. If payment has been made and a bond pursuant to Model Form 19 has been provided the Employer should consider carefully his approach to the arbitration. It may be that because the Contractor has received payment he does not want to pursue the arbitration or does not wish to be the Claimant in the arbitration. However, it would be essential that the Contractor is the Claimant in the arbitration (unless circumstances dictate that he should not be) as otherwise it would become evident to the Arbitrator that payment has been made on a Conciliator’s recommendation. It would therefore be essential that this be agreed (preferably before payment over of the recommended amount) and that the Contractor agrees to prosecute the arbitration promptly and efficiently. Arbitration Reference sub-clause 13.2 The final dispute resolution mechanism available to the parties is that of arbitration. The relevant arbitration rules are as set out in the Works Requirements. The appointing body in respect of the arbitrator’s appointment in default of agreement by the parties is that set out in the Schedule (Part 1N). Disputes under the Contract are subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts and to the Public Works Arbitration Rules 2007. The Contractor is obliged to appoint an agent for service of proceedings in the Schedule (part 2).

Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 173 14.16 Minor Works Form Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual The Minor Works Contract for the provision of Building and Civil Engineering Works designed by the Employer (the minor works contract) is in the same form as the Public Works Contract for the Provision of Building Works and Civil Engineering Works designed by the Employer (the Employer Designed or traditional contracts). The table below highlights the differences between the two forms of the above mentioned contracts. Clause references in this comparison, unless stated otherwise, relate to clauses in the traditional contracts. Clause Ref Clause Minor Works Contract 1.6 Parent Company Guarantee 2.7 Legal Opinion There is no requirement on the Contractor to provide the parent company guarantee by the starting date. There is no clause requiring the provision of a legal opinion relating to a Contractor who is not an individual or company incorporated in Ireland. 3.3.1 3.9.3 3.9.9 Insurance of Employer’s Property Unlike the traditional contracts, Part 1D of the Schedule in the minor works contract does not provide for a list of additional Employer’s property which the Contractor must insure. Extensions and Additional Requirements in the Schedule Owner Controlled Insurance Programme Part 1D of the Schedule does not provide scope for the Employer to specify extensions and additional requirements in relation to insurances. The minor works contract does not provide for the insurance programme to be owner controlled. 4.2.1(2) Supervisor The Contractor must appoint a supervisor to the site, but unlike the traditional contracts the supervisor does not need to be appointed on a full time basis 4.8 4.9 4.10 Value Engineering The minor works contract does not include a procedure for value engineering.

The LA CC has appointed consultants to design the building and the form of contract to be used is the Public Works Contract for Building Works Designed by the Employer. The various parties and consultants are: The Employer: The Architect: The Structural Engineer: The Mechanical & Electrical Consultant: The Quantity Surveyor: LA County Council The Courthouse LA Town County LA Santiago Balaclava & Associados SA Paseo D Felipe VI 08028 Barcelona España Telford, Brunel & Eiffel 35 The Heights LA Town County LA Stephenson, Edison & Babbage 46 The Heights LA Town County LA Willis Sealy Partnership 50 The Heights LA Town County LA The Architect was appointed to the project following an architectural competition. The 11,000sq m building is intended to be a flagship piece of architecture for the county and to contribute to urban regeneration within the county town. It is to be a steel framed structure with reinforced concrete basement for car parking to maximise site utilisation. The cost plan indicates an estimated construction cost of €40,000,000, including furniture and fittings and VAT but excluding professional fees. The existing stores [which has a fibrous cement roof] was build in the 1950s and is to be demolished as part of the construction contract and monies are allowed in the cost plan for this. The budget for the project is consistent with this cost plan and is extremely tight and the County Manager has stipulated that cost certainty is of the utmost importance and the project must be delivered within the cost plan. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 177 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual LA CC is currently residing at a number of addresses and its annual rental bill is €500,000 per annum. The existing Council Chamber and offices for elected representatives is located in a building which is rented at a rent of €30,000 per annum (this is included in the total rental figure mentioned above). Specifications and drawings have been drawn up for the Project by the Architect and the Design Team. A Bill of Quantities has been prepared by the consultant Chartered Quantity Surveyor. The programme for the Project indicates that construction will commence on 29 November 2007 and be completed by 30 October 2009. It is intended that the Council Chamber and accommodation for the elected representatives be completed by 31 August 2009 as the existing premises have to be vacated by this date, otherwise damages of €5,000 per week are payable to the landlord. It is envisaged that a number of Specialists be engaged by the Contractor on the Works and these include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5."

The Open Procedure has advantages, particularly programming, but it has the risk that a bidder may prepare a tender and not pass the prequalification phase. As with all procedures, it is necessary to ensure that you do not mix selection and award criteria. 19.7 If the Tender Sum exceeds the Budget, is a Bill of Reductions exclusively a post contract issue? Yes, but you must be aware of making a \"material change\" in cutting back the scope of work on which the contract is procured, potentially to the disadvantage of the other tenderers. Also, unless the procurement process is definitively complete, this process could involve an element of post tender negotiation, which is prohibited. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 255 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 19.8 The values selected for the contingent items in the MEAT example may well result in loading of the bid rates in the Tender, especially where, because of the choice of notional items below the Tender Sum, there is little impact on the MEAT Comparative Cost? These values are selected by the client and should be the expected value of the item in question, having regard to professional judgement of the client or his consultant and previous experience on similar projects. The expected value is not so low as to encourage loading of rates and is not so high as to pack the MEAT with contingent items. 19.9 If you start on an assumed Budget of less than €5m, working on the Minor Works Form of Contract, and you drift over the limit as tenders are received, do you have to change the form of contract to be used? Good budgeting should not leave you in this position, but you would have to stay with the procurement choice originally made and run with the tendered contract. 19.10 If you take tenders on one Form and found you had to use another, could this be negotiated? No form of negotiation on fundamental matters, particularly price, may take place in the open or restricted procedure. 19.11 If the estimate is just under €5m can you opt to use the Main Form? Yes, this option is available where it is appropriate to do so. One should probably opt for the main contract form in the case stated. 19.12 If the second option is chosen on delay, i.e. where no rate has been tendered, no delay element in the MEAT calculation ensues? Where daily rates are not tendered, the Employer pays only for the cost of delay actually incurred. This is not therefore an issue for assessment in the MEAT calculation. 19.13 Will the Employer have to create a rule for rebalancing items in the BOQ to ensure arithmetic errors are corrected to maintain the lump sum bottom line as fixed? Are the potential number of variables not very large, when the bottom line is being held? Should"

The expected value is not so low as to encourage loading of rates and is not so high as to pack the MEAT with contingent items. 19.9 If you start on an assumed Budget of less than €5m, working on the Minor Works Form of Contract, and you drift over the limit as tenders are received, do you have to change the form of contract to be used? Good budgeting should not leave you in this position, but you would have to stay with the procurement choice originally made and run with the tendered contract. 19.10 If you take tenders on one Form and found you had to use another, could this be negotiated? No form of negotiation on fundamental matters, particularly price, may take place in the open or restricted procedure. 19.11 If the estimate is just under €5m can you opt to use the Main Form? Yes, this option is available where it is appropriate to do so. One should probably opt for the main contract form in the case stated. 19.12 If the second option is chosen on delay, i.e. where no rate has been tendered, no delay element in the MEAT calculation ensues? Where daily rates are not tendered, the Employer pays only for the cost of delay actually incurred. This is not therefore an issue for assessment in the MEAT calculation. 19.13 Will the Employer have to create a rule for rebalancing items in the BOQ to ensure arithmetic errors are corrected to maintain the lump sum bottom line as fixed?

Are the potential number of variables not very large, when the bottom line is being held? Should there not be a commonality of approach because precedent will apply across the board anywhere these contracts are used? The approach on correction of tenders is set out in the Guidance Note in Section 2.7.3. The example given in the GN related to correction of errors in Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 256 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual calculating VAT is also relevant. The fixed price lump sum tender total remains unchanged in any correction of arithmetic error in the BoQ. 19.14 Can the Contracting Authority reject an abnormally low tender? Yes, nothing has changed with respect to this aspect of procurement procedure, and an abnormally low tender may be rejected, provided that due process under the EU Directives has been followed in arriving at the conclusion that the tender is abnormally low. 19.15 If the Tender wasn’t signed, or the Tender Sum wasn’t transferred, from the BoQ to the Tender Form correctly, is the tender disqualified? It depends on the stated position on this point in the Instructions to Tenderers. In the absence of a clear rule requiring disqualification, the Contracting Authority has discretion. Is it a proportionate response to reject a tender for such an oversight? It should be drafted so that no hair-trigger rejection responses arise on matters which can easily be clarified without risk to transparency or equal treatment. 19.16 In a Contractor Designed contract, why introduce craftsmen rates or the like in the MEAT calculation, or in valuing change orders. There is no facility for monitoring these things in Design-Build? Even where this is no BoQ, there is still a need to have a means to value Change Orders, and these rates are likely to be required for this purpose. 19.17 What of variants where the workload of assessment of the tenders or the criteria for award conflicts with the variant offered? For example, a high density development option in parallel with an Employer-preferred low density main design? Tender appraisal workload isn’t hugely different than is normal with variants at present and is accepted as covered in the services. Variants rules need to be prescribed in the Instructions to Tenderers to prevent variants at odds with the Contracting Authority's fundamental or core objectives emerging. Additional costs arising from accommodating a variant, or consequential costs in building/civil engineering, need to be planned for through risk assessment, then addressed and locked into the fixed price. 19.18 Why not accept an offer of a \"free\" parent company guarantee in lieu of the Bond?

Refer to the Guidance Note at Section 2.3.2. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 257 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 19.19 If there’s an expiry date on a Bond, can you not have a position where you threaten calling in Bond in order to get a Bond extended? It is safer to have a Bond whose expiry date is predicated upon an event such as Substantial Completion (say, 15 months after its issue) in which case the situation outlined is unlikely to arise. The difficulty in threatening to call in a bond such as the Performance Bond to be provided by the Contractor under the contract is that a call is only permitted where the Contractor is in breach or has its obligation to complete terminated. QUESTIONS ON CONTRACT FORMALITIES, PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE AND FITNESS-FOR-PURPOSE STANDARD 19.20 On signing of contract documents, are there protocols on signing every page, or on signing a particular number of copies? There are no protocols and there is no need to sign every page. However, if there are a large number of documents involved, it may be appropriate to have the parties sign or initial each bound document for identification purposes. The potential necessity for initialling or signing individual pages only becomes relevant if there are loose pages that ought to be identified separately. 19.21 What if the Contractor is tardy or reluctant to seal the contract? The Contractor is required to execute its tender under seal and the acceptance of the tender will create a contract under seal. The Bid Bond is a mechanism which can be used if there is a concern that a tenderer might not honour its tender or where a particular contract is absolutely essential to a larger project and any withdrawal by the successful tenderer would cause substantial losses etc. [see Guidance Note at Section 2.3.1.]. 19.22 What if there is a design problem with the Works after six years and before twelve years and the Contract has been executed under seal? Where a contract has been executed under seal the time within which the Employer may sue for any breach is independent of the date of the contract execution but is referable to the date of the breach of contract itself. Thus in the case outlined, the Employer could sue the relevant party for breach of contract, within twelve years from the date of the breach itself. This is likely to be the date that the actual defective design work was carried out although the final date can sometimes be different, for instance, the date by which the defective design could have been rectified by the guilty party.

In addition, the requirement that the Contractor provides a warranty from the Consultant (as a Specialist) would be provided for in the Schedule to the construction contract at part 1F). 19.34 When is PI Insurance required from a Contractor in a traditional Contract? It is not necessarily appropriate to automatically seek PI cover from a Contractor in traditional contracts. However, one must recognise the fact that the Contractor may have some small design function. Even if a Specialist has PI cover and a collateral warranty is in place, it may be felt appropriate to have the additional protection of PI cover for the Contractor, particularly as the Contractor has full responsibility in any event for all design by Specialists.

The requirement of PI cover from the Contractor is an optional one and need not be availed of unless it is deemed appropriate.

However, whichever obligation the Employer requires, the Contractor will, nevertheless have his obligation as referred to above. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 261 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 19.37 Road Traffic Act insurance is a permitted exclusion under the contracts but is this appropriate? The Contracts were carefully considered by distinguished insurance professionals and it was regarded as appropriate to exclude such matters, presumably because this insurance is in any event required by law and the Contractor is required to comply with all laws. 19.38 What does \"fit for intended purpose\" mean? In the case of goods or a manufactured product it means fit for the purpose for which such goods or items are normally used. In the case of a design it means that the overall building or plant will be suitable for its intended function (as made known in the Employer’s Requirements). 19.39 If a structure serves two purposes, must it be fit for both purposes? This will depend upon the purpose of the structure under the Contract. It would be most unlikely for a structure that has two purposes not to be required to meet the requirement for both. 19.40 Do you need two sets of contract documentation? There is only one contract but there can be as many originals as people require. It is usual to have one original set of Contract Documents for each party executing the Contract. 19.41 What are appropriate excess limits for PI Insurance? Very low excess limits are hard to get in the insurance market but an excess of 80–100k looks pretty high; one around €50k seems more appropriate for larger companies, and even this is too high for smaller companies. In many cases a limit of between €10,000 and €25,000 would be appropriate, and the excess level should be reasonable having regard to the range of firm sizes quoting for the project. 19.42 Does there need to be Model Forms included with each contract? Reference to \"Model Form 8\" would be unambiguous, but it might be useful if there was a pro-forma insertion checklist. 19.43 Why no separate Model Form for appointment of PSDP? There is a Model Form 10 covering the PSDP. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 262 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 19.44 With respect to the Form of Tender, in the quasi-contract that exists where a tender will be examined once it is validly submitted, where is the Consideration for agreement to keep open the tender? The consideration is generally regarded as the willingness of the contracting authority to consider the tender in question. 19.45 PI Insurance extends for 6 years.

You can only look for the appropriate level of PI from the outset, or else change by agreement. QUESTIONS ON STATUS OF THE BILL OF QUANTITIES 19.47 What is the function of a Bill of Quantities, when remeasurement of work no longer applies? The Bill of Quantities still serves a number of purposes, even when remeasurement no longer applies. It serves cost-effective tendering, by drawing the works items and their descriptions, which comprise the Lump Sum, into a common document for all tenderers to price on a like-for-like basis. It further assists the tender evaluation process by providing information on the balance of pricing in the tender. It is used in contract management to assist in interim certification, to predict cash flow, to assist in valuation of Change Orders and to support calculation of price variation entitlements.

The Bill of Quantities can be a Works Requirements document, as well as a Pricing Document.

If for example, there’s a piece of work which fulfils its purpose, but supporting paperwork required in Works Requirements is not complete? This would depend on the terms of the Contractor’s sub-contract with the Specialist. However the terms of this document are most unlikely to be less stringent than the Contractor’s Contract with the Employer and the provisions of this Contract will of course, include the Works Requirements. 19.58 Does a Specialist have to be named in the Contract? No, but if an entity is doing design, it is a Specialist. Normally a Specialist is named in the Works Requirements, or in the Works Proposals, and in the case of substitution, then the substitute Specialist becomes part of the Works Proposals. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 265 19.59 What form of contract would be used with a Novated Specialist? Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual Effectively the same form as main form (or other back to back form), but with some differences between selections in Schedule Part 1. Whichever form of Contract is used by the Employer, it would go straight across to the Main Contract, unaltered. Novation in this manner would be exceptional, rather than the norm. The Employer, in preparing his contract with the Specialist to be novated, would research the market to determine what minimum amendments to the standard form might have to be made to attract interest from the Specialist market. Having got unqualified tender responses, he then concludes his contract with the Specialist. The Main Contractor is instructed that he must accept this novation, in the Main Contract on the standard forms of contract without amendment. He must then take a view on whatever risk premium he needs to neutralise the effect to him of any special terms in the novated contract, so that he fully addresses this in his own price. 19.60 Is it possible to novate the Specialists as a mechanism to shoehorn Nominated Subcontractors into these Contracts? Novation is a non preferred form of procuring Specialists. The Employer does not need to use this mechanism to achieve the benefits of nomination without its problems. QUESTIONS ON COMPLETION OF THE SCHEDULES 19.61 \"Date\" for Substantial Completion. Does it have to be a real date? Not necessarily. It could be either a fixed date or as is more likely, as a duration from the date of the Letter of Acceptance. 19.62 The risk described in Part K No 8 of Schedule Part 1 uses the term \"Employers personnel\". This could potentially mean Planning Officers for a Local Authority. If they \"interfere\" in defence of a planning permission or statutory duty, is this a compensation event? There could conceivably be an argument that officers of a Local Authority not connected with the project in question did interfere with the Contractor."

There could conceivably be an argument that officers of a Local Authority not connected with the project in question did interfere with the Contractor. However, it is most unlikely that this would occur in such away as to give rise to a claim. The inclusion of a Planning Permission within the general scope of the term \"Consent\" creates an obligation on the Contractor to comply with this consent. Other legislation, that the Employer may have a duty to check compliance upon, is also included under \"Law\". If the Employer intervenes in his capacity as designated enforcement body in relation to a statutory obligation, he would be entitled to do so and there would be no entitlement to compensation arising from this. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 266 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 19.63 The definition of unforeseeable includes the phrase \"having inspected the site and surroundings\" What if a landowner prevents access to the site at the time the tenderer wishes to examine it? This is a risk which would emerge at the Clients’ own workshop on risk, and the Client would have to consider the need to arrive at a point of closure on all his contract planning before going to tender. If the land has been acquired, the Client has legal rights to prevent such action by owners of adjacent lands etc. which he should enforce. If such inspection by tenderers is frustrated as described, then the Client should review his risk allocation selections during the tender period, and decide if, given all the information provided to tenderers, it remains value for money to allocate risk as he proposes to do. 19.64 With Subsoil Investigation contracts, the Contracting Authority often cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of the SI Report and, if it included in the Works Requirements, is there therefore relief under Schedule Part 1 Section K Risk 5 for \"factual error in works requirements\"? Contracting Authorities should carefully review their management and supervision of subsoil investigation contracts to ensure that SI Contractors are held to their responsibilities under their contracts to ensure their reports are factually correct. If the SI Report is included in the Works Requirements, then factual error (and this must be outside the question of error of interpretation) will have implications under Risk 5. Presumably, if such an issue did arise and caused loss to the Employer, he would have an entitlement to pursue the site investigation contractor pursuant to that contract. 19.65 Does the figure entered under the second threshold on the programme contingency in Schedule Part 1 have to be a cumulative figure with respect to the first threshold? No, the second threshold is not cumulative, it stands as a selection in itself without regard to the numerical value selected for the first threshold.

This will allow the plant item to be incorporated, without expensive consequential effects influencing other areas of the contract, and without extra cost arising through Change Orders. 19.69 It is noted that Standard Methods of Measurement are amended by the Department of Finance in the appendices to align them with the fixed price lump sum concept. Are the NRA rules of measurement also to be amended in the same way? There will be changes to align the NRA Method of Measurement to the principles in the new contracts. 19.70 Insurance thresholds look the same in both the Minor Works and the other Forms of Contract. Is this intended by the insurance expertise advising on Conditions of Contract development? Yes. 19.71 Do all of the Contract Document features apply to Minor Works? Mostly yes, the Guidance Note has a comparison table at Appendix A. The most notable difference is the single threshold for the Programme Contingency in the Minor Works form. 19.72 Does the €5m limit on the Minor Works Contract include VAT? Yes, it is VAT inclusive. 19.73 Is it necessary to have a Performance Bond for a small contract, for example Portacabins valued at say €600k, involving no more than three certificates over 4 months? Yes. While the sum in a given contract may appear small, the problem of several contracts for the same Client with one contractor may aggregate the exposure to a much larger figure. 19.74 Do Liquidated Damages have to be related to a loss or if not, does there have to be a bonus? Yes they are related to a loss, in that the LDs must be a pre-estimate of loss and the pre-estimate must be genuine, but there’s no implied bonus. Penalties (monetary deductions greater than and unrelated to any pre-estimated loss) are unenforceable and the presence of a bonus provision will not act as a saver. If there was a bonus, it might give an indication to a court of the importance of programme to the client.

However as between himself and the Employer, he is responsible for ensuring that he can gain access via all intended access routes. He is also obliged to take reasonable steps to see that the Site traffic obeys the law and does not cause nuisance. 19.77 What is the difference between \"part\" and \"Section\" Section has a definition in terms of the contract, but a part can be any part of the works. 19.78 Can contracts with seasonal constraints be procured out of season and novated into main contract? You have to signal this intent in the Works Requirements. QUESTIONS ON CLAUSES OF THE CONTRACT 19.79 Contract refers to relevant statutory provisions in Clause 2.5. With respect to possible law changes, is a \"catch all\" not required? Refer to \"Legal requirement\" definition [Clause 2.2] and to the interpretation provision at sub-clause 1.2.2 (6) where it is stated that references to any Law includes any amendments and replacements. It covers the matter of the question. 19.80 Clause 3.3.1 What is meant by \"profit\". Why would reinstatement value for building include \"profit\"? The Contractor may have to re-build the Works if for instance they are burned down due to no fault of his, simply because he has responsibility for the Works and for their ultimate completion. It is regarded as reasonable that the Contractor in carrying out such re-building work should be entitled to his reasonable profit as otherwise he would effectively be carrying out what could be a complete reconstruction for nothing. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 270 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 19.81 Is it necessary to have all the reporting requirements and programming requirements in Clause 4 on the Minor Works Form? The reporting requirements as contained in the full contract forms are not contained in the Minor Works form, which has a far simpler provision in this regard. In the full contract forms the provisions may be relaxed by the Works Requirements or by the ER. It is in any event not a bad thing to have clear evidence that the contract is being managed properly, regardless of its size. 19.82 With respect to Article 4 of the Agreement; Is there any significance to be read into the phrase \"initial Contract Sum\", and the use of \"initial\" as a possible qualifying adjective? Could the use of a different phrase earlier in the paragraph be construed as referring to two different sums?

What is their standing in the Construction Contract Schedule 1? Their standing is simply to make the Contractor aware of the limitations agreed between the Employer and the ER in his Conditions of Engagement. This will avoid any possible claim by the Contractor that he was entitled to assume that the ER had all of the powers normally associated with his role and without any restrictions that might result in the Employer’s permission being sought for decisions. 19.85 What is the breadth of scope of \"physically impossible\" or \"contrary to Legal Requirements\", Clause 4.5.4?

If a Contractor from abroad is about to start, how can he provide this evidence in response to a Letter of Intent? He can’t do it, therefore, you can’t insist on it. Clause 5.3 does insist he does so in future under the Contract. A Certificate of Intent to do this is permissible, but seeking proof of past compliance is discriminatory. Compliance with the construction workers pension provisions in a Registered Employment Agreement is what is required during the Contract. 19.93 Specialists Clause 5.4 – Clause 5.4.6 appears to give much greater latitude to offer replacements and effectively negates Clause 5.4.5? Clause 5.4.5 describes circumstances where a Specialist is not to be continued, and Clause 5.4.6 is intended to show how a replacement is to be managed when 5.4.5 is used. 19.94 Clause 9.1.2 Before Start Date, does the Employer need sight of Tax Clearance Cert, etc. Why is this left out of items listed in the Sub- Clause? These can go into the Letter of Intent under the indicated \"catch all\" clause at the end. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 273 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 19.95 Clause 9.1.2 – If within 20 days between Start Date and Letter of Acceptance, he fails to provide any of the items listed, what is the position?. If he doesn’t provide the items, he’s in breach of contract. \"Shall\" under Clause 9.1.2 is quite strict. The Contract entitles the Employer to terminate the Contractor’s obligation to complete if he does not remedy the breach within 14 days after receiving a direction to do so. 19.96 Clause 10.5 Determination by ER. If he doesn’t respond within time for response, and Contractor has complied with notice provisions, is Claim accepted by default? No – technically the Employer would be in breach of contract but it is unlikely there would be any loss. The determination would issue late although it might be the subject of further comment in any dispute resolution process if it arose. 19.97 Insurance - Does Clause 10.9 give any comfort to employer who discovers that PI has lapsed and he wishes to insure himself and recover that cost? It might possibly although such defects are often latent and arise after the Contractor has left the Site. The question to ask is what is your real sanction in this circumstance? If he’s a repeat customer of a repeat client, one might recognise that he is likely to be in business and renewing PI policy (Although any renewal is most unlikely to provide retroactive cover). Remember a PI policy is primarily to protect the insured. (This contract does have a right of offset against other contracts with the same Employer). 19.98 When would Employer submit a Claim, if he wants to recover money for work not done, does he have to use Clause 10.9?

The phrase \"any contract\" could also mean this contract, not necessarily \"any other contract\". The Employer would have to do the calculation of the amount due under another contract. The phrase \"under any contract\" with a small \"c\" would not be construed as the Contract with a capital \"C\" Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 274 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 19.100 Are unforeseen services within a building, and not in the ground, compensation events in Clause 10.10.1.3? of Minor Works contract? No they are not Compensation Events as listed in the Schedule part 1K (item 20) as it refers specifically to such services being in the ground. Accordingly Clause 10.10.1.3 does not apply to them (as it only applies to Compensation Events). 19.101 Is there provision for milestone payments in the DB Form of Contract? Not strictly at present, but Part L could reference milestones in accordance with the Pricing Document, and milestone payments can be identified in the Pricing Document. Clause 11 as drafted would appear to be capable of accommodating this. 19.102 Clause 11.1.1.2 \"upon issue of Certificate of Substantial Completion of Works\", does (a), (b), (c), (d), not follow from that? Should not (2)(a)(b)(c) and (d) relate to (1) also relate to Interim Payments. Note \"at each of the following times\". Yes – it is clear from the wording as set out above that the statement showing the matters at (1)–(4) is required at both interim statements and at Substantial Completion. There is no time extension for issues arising in an Interim Certificate. If in doubt, they would not be paid until the following certificate. 19.103 The Payment deadline under 11.1.4, taken with the Contractors’ powers of suspension under Clause 12.3 and the obligation to check that payment on any application is properly due, all potentially create a highly condensed sequence in time? The provision of an interim statement starts a time sequence. The ER has to examine the application to comply with his own implied obligations to test it against Clause 11.4, and within 10 working days give a certificate. The Employer makes a payment within 15 working days of receipt of an invoice. It should be recalled that working days are referenced rather than calendar days. 19.104 Has \"adjudicate\" as used in clause 13.1.2 changed the role of the Conciliator?

It is likely that it will have to be borne by the party providing the bond. However, the party has a choice as to whether he wishes to provide the bond or not. It is likely that the choice would be to provide the bond in view of the fact that he is getting payment.

It is the PSDP who is responsible for the Safety File under the new Regulations, but if the Contractor has not handed over essential material for the PSDP to include in the Safety File, it would be a valid reason for giving reasons to withhold the Certificate. Otherwise, the Employer would be in control of an As-Constructed Asset for which he didn’t have a Safety File. 19.116 Hyperinflation – Is there an entitlement for hyperinflation for subsequent months after the hyperinflation month?

As \"ordinary\" contractors will normally not deal with asbestos and will not have insurance cover for it, the Contract is likely to use a Specialist who will be qualified to handle it. However as the Contract stands – the Contractor will have to provide insurance cover. 19.122 Are we looking for Contract-specific insurance now if the parties have to be co-insured? The practical implication is that there will be a schedule of co-insured parties attaching to the Contractors insurances and changing from time to time. 19.123 There’s a different Base Date for PV1 than PV2, what is the explanation? PV1.1.1(a) p76 Base Date = 31st month after Contract Date PV2 Appendix No. 1 p82(d) Base date = 37th calendar month after Designated date. Under PV1 if you sign up, and you take longer than 6 months to get the contract signed, no extra disadvantage occurs to the Employer. Same effect really, but some disadvantage to Employer in PV2, in that he has 36 months from the Designated Date, so that slippage in signing up eats into his fixed price period. Guidance Note Section 2.5.2 explains the position. Department of Finance National Public Procurement Policy Unit Page 278 Public Works Construction Contracts Training Manual 19.124 Does the definition of \"Site\" potentially designate the Contractors fabrication yard as part of the Site, thereby essentially neutralising the provisions governing payment for materials fabricated but not fixed in the Works? The definition would not include the fabrication yards unless they were stated to be so in the Contract as a place where the Works are to be executed or are identified as the Site in the Works Requirements. 19.125 If in law you hold money that might belong to a subcontractor at some remove, is there a vulnerability to suit? It is possible but the Employer is only likely to withhold such money from the Contractor because the Contractor has not paid it. Ultimately the Employer could end up holding money owed to another entity but presumably the intention would be to pay it over subject to satisfactory proof etc. 19.126 Residual Risk in a Defects Period? What if Employer puts a high value on the residual risk and is it possible the monies withheld might exceed value for remedying the defect? If you cannot extend Defects period on an item that was repaired, and you withhold money, and you methodically set out how you calculate your exposure, it is more difficult to challenge it as a penalty. The more intangible the value elements, the less defensible that would be. 19.127 Collateral warranty, when the Specialist is a designer, is there a potential tension arising from the fitness for purpose obligation of the Contractor? The obligation of reasonable skill"
